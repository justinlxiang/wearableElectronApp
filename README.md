## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- Python (v3.6 or later)
- `pyinstaller` (for packaging Python scripts)

## Installation

To get started with the Wearable Gesture Control application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/justinlxiang/wearableRobotUI.git
    cd wearableRobotUI
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS and Linux
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Install Node.js dependencies
    npm install
    npm install -g pkg
    ```

3. **Build the executables:**

    To build the Python and proxyServer executables, follow these steps:

    - **Build the proxyServer executable:**
        ```sh
        pkg proxy/proxyServer.js --output bin/proxyServer
        ```

    - **Build the Python executables:**
        ```sh
        pyinstaller --onefile app.py db.py
        ```

    Ensure that the generated executables are placed in a /bin folder.


4. **Build the application:**
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
